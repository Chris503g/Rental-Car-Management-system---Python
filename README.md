# Rental Car Management system - Python

The Rental Car Management System is a Python-based application designed to efficiently manage a fleet of rental cars. The system provides a user-friendly interface to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on rental cars, allowing administrators to add, view, modify, and remove car details as needed.

### 2. create_car()

### 3. update_car()
The "Update Car" function enables administrators to modify the details of existing rental cars. The user is first prompted to enter the car ID of the car they wish to update. The function then searches for the car with the corresponding ID in the list of rental cars. If found, the function displays the current details of the chosen car. The user is then presented with a menu to select the specific attribute they wish to modify, such as the car's brand, model, year, rental price, availability, fuel type, or transmission.

### 4. delete_car()
The "Delete Car" function allows administrators to remove a rental car from the system. Upon selection, the user is prompted to enter the car ID of the car they want to delete. The function then searches for the car with the corresponding ID in the list of rental cars. If found, it displays the details of the chosen car and prompts the user to confirm the deletion.
